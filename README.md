# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Learning Objectives
### General
*What is a binary tree*
a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. That is, it is a k-ary tree with k = 2. A recursive definition using set theory is that a binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root
 
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
  
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists   
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree  
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree   
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
